======DESCRIPTION============================================================

Video attachment for “A Heterogeneous Robotics Team for Large-Scale Seismic Sensing“ by Srikanth K. V. Sudarshan, Victor Montano, An Nguyen, Michael McClimans, Li Chang, Robert Stewart, and Aaron T. Becker at the University of Houston. 

Video shows an autonomous heterogeneous sensor deployment system using UAVs to plant immobile sensors (“SeismicDarts”, geophones with an accelerometer, micro controller, and wireless transmission) and autonomously deploy mobile sensors (“SeismicSpider”, hexapod walkers).  Hardware experiments show autonomous deployment of multiple SeismicDarts at GPS waypoints, piloted UAV recovery and redeployment of SeismicDarts, and autonomous deployment and piloted recovery of SeismicSpiders. Simulations of seismic surveys show automation has reduced cost and time.
