\subsection{Simulation Studies}

A scheduling system to compare  time and costs for seismic surveys with varying numbers of UAVs, SeismicSpiders, SmartDarts, and Human manual laborers was coded in  {\sc Matlab}, available at \cite{Srikanth2016seismicScheduler}.

This tool allows us to examine engineering and logistic trade-offs quickly in simulation.  For example, Fig.~\ref{fig:DronevsTime} assumes a fixed number of darts, and examines the finishing time with $5$ to $500$ UAVs.  The time required decays asymptotically, but $140$ drones requires only twice the amount of time required for $500$ drones, indicating that $140$ are sufficient for the task. Lines are also plotted for $5000, 1000 and 500$ total darts.  In each case, substantial cost savings can be obtained by selecting the number of UAVs required to complete within $5\%$ of the optimal time.
The tool is useful for comparing the effectiveness of heterogeneous teams.  Table Fig.~\ref{fig:Sim_table} compares surveying a $1$ km x $10$ km strip of land with team (a) $5000$ seismic spiders(hexapods), (b) $500$ UAVs and $5000$ smart darts, (c) $500$ humans and $5000$ sensors(geophones).  Team (b) completed $6$ times faster than team (c).
In Fig.~\ref{fig:het_sen_ratio} we vary the percentage of individual type of sensor by keeping the total number of sensors a constant. The goal is to analyze ratios of different sensors to optimize cost and time. The number of drones employed for deploying smart darts is considered to be $10\%$ of number of smart darts available. We observe that employing UAVs brings down the deployment time. This is obvious since UAVs move at 20 m/s whereas SeismicSpiders move at 0.2 m/s. The drastic difference in velocities makes the UAV deployment time efficient. The SeimicSpiders are a special type of sensor that could be used for special cases like hard surface sensing or regions where it is difficult for UAvs to access like forests.
