\todobox{add figure of plot of pneumatic cannon firing angle vs ending angle}


\subsection{Simulation Studies}

A scheduling system to compare  time and costs for seismic surveys with varying numbers of Deployment Units, SeismicSpiders, SmartDarts, and Human manual laborers was coded in  {\sc Matlab}, available at \cite{Srikanth2016seismicScheduler}.
