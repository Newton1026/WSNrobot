\section{UAV and deployment unit}\label{sec:DeploymentUnit(UAV)}

\subsection{Design}
The UAV is a custom-built 
\todobox{An: I want to know about the deployment unit.  }

 The SmartDart deployment mechanism allows the UAV to carry four Smart Darts in a circular array, and release them when it reaches the desired GPS location, one at a time. 
 The rear of the dart has a circular tip that locks into the deployment mechanism, and rests on a rectangular slot-path. 
 A servomotor rotates the dart tips through the rectangular slot-path, allowing darts to release from a circular opening.

\subsection{Experiment}


\subsubsection{Autonomous drop demonstration and accuracy}

The current drone can place the SmartDart within $\pm1$ m of the desired location.  
This range is within tolerances for seismic surveys because
(1) there are often features (rocks, water, etc.) that require this amount of error from theoretically assigned locations,
(2) some survey designs include a random placement component to improve noise cancellation,
(3) this error minimally perturbs  the data since seismic waves travel at 600 m/s in near surface, so a one-meter inaccuracy equates to $\approx$1.6 ms delay,
(4) the response of a receiver to seismic vibrations is an average over a number of meters.

The critical factor is to know within 10 cm accuracy the geophone location.  Such accuracy can be obtained thorugh Real Time Kinematic GPS systems. Knowledge of the exact location allows corrections for jitter in signal arrival times due to  placement inaccuracy.

The UAS is a 177 cm wing span hexacopter, controlled by the Pixhawk flight controller running ArduPilot Mega flight software. The UAS has a 3DR GPS module using the UBlox NEO-7 chipset.

For the accuracy test, 6 sets of darts, 4 darts in each set, were dropped on the same GPS waypoint. Between each drop, the UAV travelled to a nearby GPS waypoint to cancel out the flight controller's stable hover.  This path is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Accu_test_darts}a. The UAV returned to the launch platform to be reloaded and data was recorded after each set.

To record data, one dart was picked from the first set as the reference point (the lower left in Fig.~\ref{fig:Accu_test_darts}b), hence the first data point will be 0,0. A 1-m T-square was placed with the origin at the dart's drop point to establish the axes.

After the first set of data was been recorded, the darts were collected and reloaded on the UAV for the next deployment set.
 A rod was placed in the position of the first dart to keep reference as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Accu_test_darts}c. 
 The T-square was kept in place and mason twine was suspended to lengthen the reference axes. 
 Future deployment were measured  using the reference point and axes.
