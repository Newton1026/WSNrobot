Exp 1: Drop tests as function of height, compare twisted vs straight tail, depth and angle\\
Exp 2: Drop tests as function of soil type, compare twisted vs straight tail, depth and angle\\
Exp 3: Automatic drop from drone, accuracy in placement\\
Exp 4: Dart sensing accuracy vs ground setup\\
Exp 5: Data transmission (what plot can we make for this?)\\
Exp 6:
