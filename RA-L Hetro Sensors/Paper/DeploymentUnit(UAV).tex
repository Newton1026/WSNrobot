\subsection{Design}
Task Allocation Theory : I want to explore how to assign k smart darts, m hexapods, and n drones  (k=500,m=20, n = 10).  
How should we assign them?  
What changes as k,m,n shift?
Can we write this as a linear program?
Can we reuse Srikanthâ€™s old code, but adapt it for 3D topology?
