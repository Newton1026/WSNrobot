%(http://www.eoearth.org/view/article/155968/) Seismic exploration is the search for commercially economic subsurface deposits of crude oil, natural gas, and minerals by the recording, processing, and interpretation of artificially induced shock waves in the earth
\begin{abstract}

Seismic imaging is one of the major techniques (and industries in Texas) for subsurface exploration and involves generating a vibration which propagates into the ground, echoes, and is then recorded using motion sensors. There are numerous sites of resource or rescue interest that may be difficult or hazardous to access. In addition, there is often  many places to survey, which require a great deal of hand labor. Thus, there is a substantial need for unmanned sensors that can be deployed by air and potentially in large numbers. This paper presents working prototypes of an Autonomous Flying Vibration Sensor that can fly to a site, land, then listen for echoes and vibrations, transmit the information, and subsequently return to its home base.
One design uses four geophone sensors (with spikes) in place of the landing gear.  This provides a stable landing attitude, redundancy in sensing, and ensures the geophones are oriented perpendicular to the ground. The paper describes hardware experiments demonstrating the efficacy of this technique and comparing with traditional manual techniques.


%Our overall goal is to design, build, and demonstrate the use of motion sensing drones for seismic surveys, earthquake monitoring, and remote material testing


%Seismic exploration induces shock waves in the earth and records the resulting vibrations to search for hydrocarbons located below the surface of the earth. The placement of these sensors is critical for accurate reconstruction of the underlying geology. Currently sensors are placed manually and connected by long cables.  This paper presents a robotic solution by using an aerial drone to accurately place the vibration sensors.  The paper presents an instrumented quadcopter that uses four spike-form geophones in plapce of its landing gear  experimental results 

%[OLD] Seismic exploration techniques help in locating and estimating hydrocarbons present in a crude form. Instead of a random search we can precisely locate the presence of these hydrocarbons which help us save millions of dollars. Hydrocarbons (coal, oil, natural gas) fulfill more than half the energy demands currently and is necessary for socio-economic development. The equipment used for seismic exploration are in general bulky and are connected using cables and the process requires tremendous manual labor. The goal of this paper is to prove this process can be automated by using Unmanned Air Vehicles (Quadcopters) to place the geophones (sensors for detecting seismic disturbances) at precise locations. The combined setup can self-deploy at a location, collect and transmit data, relocate and recharge autonomously. A hardware demonstration is performed to prove the feasibility of the model and an experimental survey is conducted to compare the proposed setup with the existing traditional setups on a small scale. The results prove the proposed model has superior efficiency in terms of energy, cost and time. This idea can be extrapolated to a large scale, there by revolutionizing the seismic sensing and data acquisition industry. Since it has the potential to reduce expenditure and increase efficiency.
