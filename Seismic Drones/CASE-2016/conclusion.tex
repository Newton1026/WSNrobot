 \section{Conclusion}\label{sec:Conclusion}
This paper presented an autonomous technique for geophone placement, recording, and retrieval.  This can enable automating a job that currently requires large teams of manual laborers 
 The paper described hardware experiments demonstrating the efficacy of this technique and comparing it with traditional manual techniques.
 There are many opportunities for future work.  
 
 The current drones are not designed for long stationary periods and must be weatherized.  It may be more beneficial to deploy one or more sensor packages and return the drone to a home base.   There are many opportunities for teams of drones to divide the task of sensor placement.
